It was a while, I was very busy from the work (principally) to some personal things.
This want not be a excuse, but sound like it.
Also, this year has been full of events that made me growing up and I'm very happy beacuse I did things that I didn't imagine doing.
I never did it, but this time I want draw up a list of good intentions for my self,
and I want publish it: maybe, in this way I can keep the commitments.

## "The year of (healthy) egoism"!

##### 1 - Drop below 100 kg

In 2018 I reached the weight of 170kg because I was eating a lot, mainly for stress.
With time and patience, I worked on my personal problems that caused me hunger
and in May 2018 I have also started a diet.
At the end of 2018, I reached the weight of 130kg.
So, I would like bring my weight under 100kg at the of this year.

##### 2 - Improve (for real) my english

I just do it!
Lately, situations have arisen that they have shown me I need it.

##### 3 - Hold the current work constancy

As I wrote, this year has been full of stimulating and intense professional activities.
I would like keep this constancy because I realized that feel me good and still growing up.

##### 4 - Learn to play ukulele

Yes, I bought an ukulele and I want learn play it because of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzB2cN-AU8w).
