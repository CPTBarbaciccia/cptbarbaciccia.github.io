# First Commit

Here we go, I finally made my blog and I don't know where I should start from (who has ever had one of it?).
Whatever, I'm of opinion that if someone starts a blog they should have something to write or share.
About this, I would premise/warn:

- I would write my posts in english as possible, but my english is bad (really, Google Translate help me a lot);
- It's all an experiment, I would use this blog to write about my experiences and of mine misadventues;
- I would use this to blog to improve my self (**above all, english**)
- I'm a "randomer" guy (I'm a [Douglas Adams][Douglas_Adams]'s big fan) and I love all that (apparently) doesn't have sense.

And, regarding this last point...

## Who am I?

I should write the "about.md" and I have scheduled to do it:
[README.md][readme_me] (3fac99b).
So, I'll effort to do it asap. Please, don't hate me at least for now üßô

## Some things before close

### Let's try highlights

I hope to use very much this "Jekyll"'s feature.

Ruby (with .linenos):
{% highlight ruby linenos%}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Pingu')
#=> prints 'Hi, Pingu' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
print("CIAONE PINGU")
#=> yes, also in python comments are made like this
{% endhighlight %}

### "Why you do this?"

As I written above, I feel the need to write about my "misadventures".
In the last year, in addition to traveling so many, I learned and improve my IT skills and I want leaving a trace of what I'm doing.
In this way I feel to contribute to open source community.
By the way, let's stop being so serious üòÅ

PS: for those who do not know who PINGU is - [Pingu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingu)
