Hey there,
I'm Luke Cottage, an Italian guy who trying to writing a blog in english (perhaps failing at the start).
However, joke aside, I'm an enthusiast, nerd, geek, and random guy that love each things have electronics parts.

### About this blog

I'm of opinion that if someone starts a blog they should have something to write or share something of quality.
Ã¹
I'm not a "front-ender" or designer or similar, so it wasn't so easy for me to made this blog:
if I had to start all over again, maybe I could do little; jekyll + github-pages helped me a lot.
Just this should explain why I started it.

I want to improve my self and all my skills (Computer science, electronics, development, etc ...) and I would like excel in those.
It seems pretentious, or well, it is and I feel a good ways is to write about my experiences in this blog.

Also, this is a way to contribute to open source community that helped me to grow up my passion and my will to work in this field.
