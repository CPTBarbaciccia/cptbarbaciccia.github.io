Hey there,
I'm Luke Cottage, an Italian guy who trying to writing a blog in english (perhaps failing at the start).
However, joke aside, I'm an enthusiast, nerd, geek, and random guy that love each things have electronics parts.

### About this blog

I'm of opinion that if someone starts a blog they should have something to write or share something of quality.
I'm not a "front-ender" or designer or similar, so it wasn't so easy for me to made this blog:
if I had to start all over again, maybe I could do little; jekyll + github-pages helped me a lot.
Just this should explain why I started it.

I want to improve my self and all my skills (Computer science, electronics, development, etc ...) and I would like excel in those.
It seems pretentious, or well, it is and I feel a good ways is to write about my experiences in this blog.

Also, this is a way to contribute to open source community that helped me to grow up my passion and my will to work in this field.

### About me

I don't want stay here to writing all my experiences (for that there is the CV) but I would like to write a summary describing me for my technical skills.
I graduated as electronics technician and then I started to work in a company that deals with industrial automation.
Next I began the university (which I never ended) and at the same time I worked as help desk, sysadmin, "developer", etc... until today!

At the moment I am working as DevOps in a consulting firm, because (someone told me) I'm good at Software Engineering, sysOps and QA.
So, as someone said, I'm a "maledetto devops" (in english: damn devops).
Yup!

I don't deny that sometimes I miss doing something electronic:
I feel confident with all that using bits, like an AVR, or a Cortex-M0 or a FPGA, etc...
And more the things works a low-level, more I love its!

### :(){ :|:& };:

And yes, it's a fork bomb but it's always a great inspiration for me.
Maybe this describe me better than what I wrote before.
For me it isn't only a fork bomb or a (very bad) joke to do to someone, no.

For me is the best ever code was wrote until now.
Perfectly indented, clear, visually beautiful!

And every time I'm writing codes, I want is "perfectly indented, clear, visually beautiful" like that fork bomb!

# In the end
