## Luke Cottage's blog
Finally, I made my blog (maybe!?). :suspect:

### What I'm using
* [github-pages](https://pages.github.com/) (what else?!);
* [Captainâ€™s log](https://github.com/mashlo/captains-log) is a minimalistic & responsive theme - made by [Masha Safina](http://masha.space);
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) "is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator";
* [pygments-css](https://github.com/richleland/pygments-css) for highlight code theme;
* lot of patience, because I'm not a "front-ender" (or something similar).

### TO DO
See [issues](https://github.com/x21Kenobi/x21kenobi.github.io/issues)
