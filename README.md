## Luke Cottage's blog
Finally, I made my blog (maybe!?). :suspect:

### What I'm using
* [github-pages](https://pages.github.com/) (what else?!);
* [Captainâ€™s log](https://github.com/mashlo/captains-log) is a minimalistic & responsive theme - made by [Masha Safina](http://,asha.spacei);
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) "is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator";
* lot of patience, because I'm not a "front-ender" (or something similar).

### TO DO
- [ ] write 'about.md'
- [ ] add a valid email to contact me
- [ ] add favicon (animated if is possible)
- [ ] adjust the 'linenos' in highlight
- [ ] create a 404.html page
- [ ] add search bar
- [ ] add category dropdown menu
